DESCRIPTION					     *LineJuggler-description*

This plugin offers mappings to quickly duplicate and move lines to above /
below the current line. A [count] either specifies the number of lines, or the
relative visible target line, therefore it's especially easy to clone lines
when 'relativenumber' is set.
The mappings can save you several keystrokes over an explicit |dd|/
|yy|[{motion}, ...]|p| sequence in cases where the other lines are nearby and
visible in the current window.

Oftentimes, duplication in source code is a code smell. Please use this plugin
responsibly ;-)

RELATED WORKS								     *

- Idea, design and implementation of the [<Space> and [e mappings are based on
  Tim Pope's unimpaired.vim plugin (vimscript #1590). In addition, unimpaired
  provides other, unrelated functionality (all via [... / ]... mappings), but
  doesn't offer customization of the mappings.

USAGE							   *LineJuggler-usage*

						       *[<Space>* *v_[<Space>*
[<Space>                Add [count] blank lines above the current line / above
			the start of the selection.
						       *]<Space>* *v_]<Space>*
]<Space>                Add [count] blank lines below the current line / below
			the end of the selection.

								   *[e* *v_[e*
[e                      Move the current line / selection [count] lines above.
								   *]e* *v_]e*
]e                      Move the current line / selection [count] lines below.

								   *[E* *v_[E*
[E                      Exchange the current line / selection with the closed
			fold / same amount of visible lines located [count]
			lines above.				   *]E* *v_]E*
]E                      Exchange the current line / selection with the closed
			fold / same amount of visible lines located [count]
			lines below.
								   *[d* *v_[d*
[d			Duplicate the current line / selection to [count]
			lines above the current line / above the start of the
			selection.				   *]d* *v_]d*
]d			Duplicate the current line / selection to [count]
			lines below the current line / below the end of the
			selection.

									  *[D*
[D			Duplicate the current  / [count] lines to above the
			current line.					*v_[D*
{Visual}[D		Duplicate the selection [count] times above the
			selection.					  *]D*
]D			Duplicate the current  / [count] lines to below that
			range.						*v_]D*
{Visual}]D		Duplicate the selection [count] times below the
			selection.

									  *[f*
[f			Fetch the line [count] visible lines below the current
			line and duplicate it below the current line.	  *]f*
]f			Fetch the line [count] visible lines above the current
			line and duplicate it below the current line.	*v_[f*
{Visual}[f		Fetch the same number of visible lines starting from
			the line [count] lines below the current line and
			duplicate them above the start of the selection.*v_]f*
{Visual}]f		Fetch the same number of visible lines starting from
			the line [count] lines above the current line and
			duplicate them below the end of the selection.
									  *[r*
[r			Fetch the line [count] visible lines below the current
			line and replace the current line with it.	  *]r*
]r			Fetch the line [count] visible lines above the current
			line and replace the current line with it.	*v_[r*
{Visual}[r		Replace the selection with the same number of visible
			lines fetched starting from the line [count] lines
			below the current line.				*v_]r*
{Visual}]r		Replace the selection with the same number of visible
			lines fetched starting from the line [count] lines
			above the current line.


			When the cursor is on / the selection contains a
			closed fold, the entire set of folded lines is used.
			All mappings treat closed folds as a fixed entity, so
			they will never move / duplicate into a closed fold,
			always over it.
			A [count] specifies visible lines, closed folds are
			counted as one line, so you can use the
			'relativenumber' column to easily reach a target.
			(Except for |v_[d| and |v_]d| when at the opposite
			side of the selection.)

CONFIGURATION					   *LineJuggler-configuration*

If you want to use different mappings, map your keys to the
<Plug>(LineJuggler...) mapping targets _before_ sourcing this script (e.g. in
your |vimrc|): >
    nmap <silent> <C-Up>   <Plug>(LineJugglerBlankUp)
    nmap <silent> <C-Down> <Plug>(LineJugglerBlankDown)
    vmap <silent> <C-Up>   <Plug>(LineJugglerBlankUp)
    vmap <silent> <C-Down> <Plug>(LineJugglerBlankDown)

HISTORY							 *LineJuggler-history*

1.10    23-Jul-2012
CHG: Split [f and {Visual}[f behaviors into two families of mappings:
a) [f to fetch below current line and {Visual}[f to fetch selected number of
   lines above/below selection
b) [r to fetch and replace current line / selection.

1.00	20-Jul-2012
Initial release.

0.01	12-Mar-2012
Started development.
